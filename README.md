# Chimera - A Fast ⚡ & Powerful JSON Server built with Rust 🦀

## 🔱 Introduction

Chimera is a blazing-fast, configurable JSON server built with Rust and Actix-web. It allows you to serve JSON files as APIs with sorting, pagination, simulated latency, and route-based retrieval. Ideal for prototyping, mock APIs, or rapid development.

Now with **automatic data generation and null value simulation**, Chimera helps you mock more realistic and dynamic API responses effortlessly.

## 🚀 Features

- **📂 Serve JSON as an API** – Load any JSON file and serve it as structured API endpoints.
- **🧬 Auto Data Generation** – Generate mock data automatically from schema-based definitions.
- **🚫 Null Value Simulation** – Add controlled nulls to fields for realistic data modeling.
- **📌 Route-based Data Retrieval** – Fetch data by route and ID.
- **📊 Sorting Support** – Sort entries dynamically based on attributes.
- **📑 Pagination Support** – Limit the number of records per request.
- **🐌 Simulated Latency** – Mimic real-world API delays for better testing.
- **⚡ Ultra-Fast Performance** – Leveraging Rust and Actix-web for speed and efficiency.
- **🛠️ Easy Configuration** – Set up ports, file paths, latency, sorting, and pagination via CLI.

## 📦 Installation

### On Windows

On Powershell (Run as Administer)
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/AMS003010/Chimera/releases/download/v0.5.0/chimera-windows.exe" -OutFile "chimera.exe"
```

On Powershell (non-privileged)
```
.\chimera.exe --path data.json
```

### On Linux and Mac

```
curl -sL $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/AMS003010/chimera/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | test("chimera.*")) | .browser_download_url') -o chimera
chmod +x chimera
./chimera --path data.json
```

## 🏗️ Usage

### Start the Server

```sh
./chimera --path data.json
```

### Available Options

| Flag             | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `--path <file>`  | Path to the JSON file (Required)               |
| `--port <port>`  | Specify the server port (Default: 8080)        |
| `--latency <ms>` | Simulated latency in milliseconds (Optional)   |
| `--sort <route> <asc / desc> <attribute>` | Sort route data dynamically |
| `--page <num>`   | Paginate GET responses (Default: 0 - No Limit) |
| `-X`/`--auto_generate_data` | Enable auto-generation from a schema JSON |

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint        | Description                      |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/ping`         | Health check (`Pong 🏓`)         |
| `GET`    | `/{route}`      | Retrieve all data under a route  |
| `GET`    | `/{route}/{id}` | Retrieve a specific record by ID |
| `POST`   | `/{route}`      | Add a record under a route       |
| `DELETE` | `/{route}`      | Delete all records under a route |
| `DELETE` | `/{route}/{id}` | Delete a specific record by ID   |

## 🔧 Auto Data Generation

With the `-X` flag, Chimera can generate data on the fly using a schema JSON structure like:
```
{
    "routes": [
        {
            "path":"data",
            "no_of_entries": 2,
            "schema": {
                "mssg_id": "id",
                "created_on": "date",
                "mssg": "lorem"
            },
            "null_percentage": 0
        },
        {
            "path":"products",
            "no_of_entries": 7,
            "schema": {
                "id": "id",
                "rsnd": "integer",
                "name": "name",
                "probability": "boolean"
            },
            "null_percentage": 0
        }
    ]
}
```
Pass this JSON file as an argument to `--pass`. 
- `no_of_entries`: Number of mock entries to generate
- `schema`: Define fields and their data type (`name`, `id`, `date`, `lorem`, etc.)
- `null_percentage`: Percentage of fields and rows to be randomly set as `null`

## 📜 Example JSON File (`data.json`)

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 25 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 30 }
  ],
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "Rust is amazing!" }
  ]
}
```
